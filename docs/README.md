### Setup complete:

To interact with Kubernetes set your KUBECONFIG environment variable
export KUBECONFIG="$HOME/.consul_k8s/kubeconfig.yml"

Consul can be accessed at: http://localhost:8500

When finished use "consul-k8s-dev down" to cleanup and remove resources

## Tools
If you do not have `kubectl` or `consul` installed you can use the built in tools. The tools run in an interactive
Docker shell and can be accessed by running the `tools` sub command with an optional path which is mapped to the 
container `/work` folder. If no path is specified then the current path is mapped to work.

```bash
➜ consul-k8s-dev tools $GOPATH/src/github.com/nicholasjackson/demo-consul-service-mesh/kubernetes/traffic_splitting
