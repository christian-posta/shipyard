## Tools
If you do not have `kubectl` or `consul` installed you can use the built in tools. The tools run in an interactive
Docker shell and can be accessed by running the `tools` sub command with an optional path which is mapped to the 
container `/work` folder. If no path is specified then the current path is mapped to work.
